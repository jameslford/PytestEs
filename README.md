# Description

### [Pytest-Elasticsearch](https://github.com/ClearcodeHQ/pytest-elasticsearch)

This library was inspired by and borrows heavily from [pytest-elasticsearch](https://github.com/ClearcodeHQ/pytest-elasticsearch). PytestEs however, is designed to be more flexible, offer a bit more automation, and generally be more inline with what I personally would like out of a pytest Elasticsearch testing library.
